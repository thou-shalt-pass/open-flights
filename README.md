## Introduction
Our final project uses airports and route dataset from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html) to find the shortest air-path between two given airports and the relatively important airports.

We implemented Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between two airports, PageRank algorithm to find important airports.

## File description

### data
contains the the airport and route dataset from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html)
- `airport_ori.csv` and `route_ori.csv` are the original source file
- `airport_scc.csv` and `route_scc.csv` are the largest strongly connected component within the source file

### documents
contains `contract.md`, `log.md`, and `proposal.md`

### includes
contains all header files for source files

### src
contains all source files
- `all_pairs_shortest_paths.cpp`: Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- `data.cpp`: read in and process source data into adjacency matrix and adjacency list
- `importance.cpp`: PageRank algorithm
- `matrix_operation.cpp`: matrix operation support for eigenvector implementation of PageRank
- `strongly_connected_components.cpp`: strongly connected component algorithm

## Running Instruction

### Main Drivers

The main entry is divided into two part: algorithm_driver and result_interpreter. 
The reason of that is algorithm_driver will run all algorithms and takes ~82min on EWS 
since it runs all algorithm and major time spent on Floyd-Warshall. 
We divide the responsibilities into two part: computational and user interaction. 

#### algorithm_driver 

Run strongly connected components algorithm, three algorithms finding importance of airports, and Floyd-Warshall. 
Then store raw data in csv and zip into `result.tar.gz` because raw data is very big (~800MB).

- Compile: `make algorithm_driver`

- Run: `./bin/algorithm_driver [airport-dataset-filename] [airline-dataset-filename]` 

(`[airport-dataset-filename]` and `[airline-dataset-filename]` are optional 
and the default values are `data/airport.csv` and `data/route.csv`)

There are 6072 airports in `data/airport.csv`. 
To short run time (for the purpose of demo), 
we can use `./bin/algorithm_driver data/airport_small.csv` 
where `data/airport_small.csv` only contains first 200 airports in `data/airport.csv`. 

#### result_interpreter 

Read result from algorithm_driver. 
Interact with users. 

- Compile: `make result_interpreter`

- Run: `./bin/result_interpreter [result-zip-filename]`

(`[result-zip-filename]` is optional 
and the default value is `result.tar.gz`)

We can run `./bin/result_interpreter expected_result.tar.gz` 
to interpret the precomputed result from the default dataset (`data/airport.csv` and `data/route.csv`). 

### Test Cases (exclude tests_importance_mutual_actual)

- Compile + Run: `sh run_tests.sh`

### Test Case (only tests_importance_mutual_actual)

- Compile: `make tests_importance_mutual_actual`

- Run: `./bin/tests_importance_mutual_actual`

This will take ~12min on EWS.

The reason of excluding this test case from "tests all" is 
this test case takes too long 
since it compares the result of `ImportanceIteration`, `ImportanceEigenvectorByLU` and `ImportanceEigenvectorByGaussian` mutually by inputing the default dataset (`data/airport.csv` and `data/route.csv`).
