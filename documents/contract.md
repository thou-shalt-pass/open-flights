# Communication

## Team Meetings

Our team will meet every Friday in Siebel Center at 3pm. We will talk about our progress and any potential problems. We will also connect actively using Message. 

## Assistance

We connect each other through email and Message. Every team member has the obligation to respond to others' messages in 24 hours. 

## Respect

We will create a group chat in Message in which we can all post our ideas and opinions, where all others can see and be looked into. Therefore, we ensure that all can deliver their opinion.  

# Collaboration

## Work Distribution

We will select a time to work on the projects together for 2 - 4 hours. We will determine the work for each member. If a member cannot finish his work in the gathering, he needs to complete the work in his own time before the next meeting. 

# Time Commitment

Each member is expected to work for 2-5 hours per week to complete his assigned work. 
Conflict Resolution: If any conflict occurs, including time conflict and conflict on design and implementation of our project. We will vote and follow the choice agreed by any two of the members.
