We talked in person about several parts of the project so I have a reasonable idea of your plans at the moment and the goal of resubmitting the proposal was accomplished so there's no major issues here.

I will note that I will probably be a little stricter next week (and moving forward) about providing a bit more detail to your development log entries. In particular I would like to see more than one sentence in each block.

To give some suggestions -- instead of 'finish implementing pagerank' (which I cant meaningfully give advice on) if you had a few specific tasks to accomplish pagerank I could be of more assistance. For example:

```bash
Next week we want to finish implementing PageRank. Currently we have <insert graph format here> but we still need to write a matrix multiplication function. <Person A> will be handling the damping factor. <Person B> will be writing a small scale test of 5 nodes so we can observe the correctness of the algorithm.
```

It doesn't have to be that thorough (though it could be more thorough then that too!).
