This is the last dev log feedback so good job overall!

It looks like your readme is mostly there -- be sure to include reproducible instructions for running each algorithm and your tests! It sounds like your dataset (when processed) is still quite large so be sure to either provide a way to reproduce your data processing or a way to transfer the processed data.

Aside from that just make sure that your final presentation focuses on the development of the project and has some visual aids (not your code!) that goes over your algorithms and any major issues you encountered.

The final report should explicitly state the final input / output for your functions, a summary of the output on your full dataset (when possible), **and a description / statement with proof about how your algorithm was tested and why it is correct.**
