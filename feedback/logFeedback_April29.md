Apologies for the late feedback! A good amount of progress again which is great to see.

On the eigenvector issue, have you considered restricting the precision of your eigenvector to a few decimal places? If I had to choose between something approximately accurate or computational intractable, I WOuld definitely pick the former. (Unless of course the end result is significantly off)

Aside from that, good to see that you are almost done with the project!
