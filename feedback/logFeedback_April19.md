A lot of progress this week which was great to see!

Good to see you identified and corrected an issue with airports missing codes (and potentially corrected when an airport name has a comma in it?)

On your plan to test pagerank:
- Why is a strongly connected component going to be a good test for Pagerank?
- I would encourage you to test pagerank using some small graphs where you can mathematically work out how the probability will 'flow' each iteration.

The same is true for your other tests. As some suggestions in that space:
- DFS there are many examples in class you can coopt and confirm
- Strongly connected component I would encourage you to use a slightly larger graph that has a few 'shapes' of strongly connected components mixed with things that are partially connected.

Overall excellent job this week.
