### Grade
Sophisticated (100%)

### Comments
A reasonable team contract that hits all major points and was signed by everyone. 

**Respect** I would encourage you to have some manner of rotating leadership in your weekly meetings to make sure that during the in-person meeting, everyone has a chance to talk and contribute to planning. 

**Work Distribution** I would also encourage some manner of rotating job to write the development log (or at least be in charge of drafting it).
